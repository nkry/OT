# OT FE

- Vimeo/vimeo fullscreen (DONE, just need to tidy up code)
- Text cursor 'PAUSE' and 'PLAY' on video?
- Mobile, tablet + large screen styles
- Configure/style jsx so whatever is input in backend renders as it does with static content
- Plug in backend when frontend is ready
- CSSGrid breaks in safari; need to use v10 + above? (update OS)
- Custom cursors?
- Conditionals (styles + content) based on data from backend


# Ideas
- Instead of updating /content to have videos stacked non fullscreen vertically, use the sidebar text to say something like 'â†’ Next Video'? (if there is more than one); it could then update state/update the video playlist. Could read 'Now Playing: 'Video Name' then on hover could change to the title of next video (would be CTA) ?
